## This tools may no longer work with the latest version of MarginNote.

This tool was written several years ago, and most likely the format of the apkg
file exported by MN has been changed so far.

## What is this

Fix the anki cards exported by MarginNote3 (up to 3.4.3). The problems I suffer are:
- Only one anki card is generated, even if there are multiple clozes.
- Inconsistent & confusing format of the card front / back for cards w/ clozes in the title and cards w/o.
- MN tags appear in the back of the anki card.

This script reads the contents of generated `apkg` file, and makes use of [genanki](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki) package to rewrite it to a better one.

## Visual Comparison

### Original apkg imported into Anki

- title shown in bottom
- only one card for 3 clozes
- tag is shown in the back card

### Improved apkg imported into Anki

## Limitations

1. All existing MN3 anki cards must be deleted from anki first. Otherwise the import would fail.
2. Cards with images/videos/audios are not supported.

## How to use

1. Make sure python3 is installed on your Mac.
2. Install the requirements
```sh
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the script to fix the exported apkg file before importing them to anki.
```sh
./fix_mn_anki_exports.py fix /path/to/apkg
```

You'll see output like this:
```

[09/14/2019 23:00:47][fix_mn_anki_exports]: Generating output file /tmp/output.apkg
```

The improved apkg would be `/tmp/output.apkg`.
